== Description ==

## Portfolio for Photographers
Photography Portfolio is a plugin made for real people, real photographers. Install the plugin, add your portfolio entries and you have a portfolio! Simple as that! Doesn't which WordPress theme you use!

After years of making premium Photography WordPress themes, we decided that the world really needs a simple, yet powerful Photography Portfolio plugin, which is why Photography Portfolio is finally here.
It's simple enough that anyone can use it (not to worry, if it's not simple enough for you, we're already working on video tutorials), yet flexible enough to be extended by any theme developer with plenty of WordPress hooks and action!

## Quick Overview
Version 1.0.0 is quite minimal and simple, so here is a quick overview:
* You have a single portfolio on your site
* In that portfolio you add "Portfolio Entries", and each entry contains a single Gallery and an optional description.
* Each portfolio entry can be attached to as many "portfolio categories" as you like.

Photography Portfolio posts work and function exactly like regular WordPress posts. The only difference is that for each post you get a "gallery field" for your images that is then nicely presented in a pretty layout.
And of course - you can click on images to open a popup gallery.


## This plugin requires at least PHP 5.4
If you have at least a decent hosting provider - you don't have to worry about your PHP Version.
However, If you can't activate the plugin because of an insufficient PHP Version - it may be time to migrate to a better provider.



== Installation ==

1. Upload "Photography Portfolio" plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
